# Visualization-Of-Energy-Generation-Of-US-For-Last-3-Decades

Data visualization is that the graphical illustration of information and data. By using visual components like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools give an easier way see and perceive trends, outliers, and patterns information.

In the world of huge information, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to investigate huge amounts of knowledge and build data-driven selections.

As the part of our assignment we have worked on visualizing the data set on “Energy Generation of US for the Last 3 Decades” which had 5 attributes 

•	Year
•	State
•	Producer Type
•	Energy Source 
•	Generation

The data set contained 49550 rows , the year attribute represents the years from 1990 to 2017, State represents the various energy producing state in US, Producer type are the companies who generates  energy , Energy source represents the type of energy resources generated during the particular period and generation gives the energy generated in megawatt hours

We took the data set from https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/  and it was last updated on 2017. With this data set we are trying to visualize the county’s energy production in various criteria
